So the next question is <strong>if I <em>touch</em> A fomite am I going to get infected...?</strong> And the answer is <em>no</em> Unless you <em>also</em> Take what you <em>touch</em> And you touch your <em>face</em> OK more <em>specifically</em> Touch... The mucous membranes of the <em>eyes</em> The nose or inside the <em>mouth</em>...(eh) that's what you need to do with that particular fomite <s type=repetition>the the the</s> <em>virus</em> Itself is not going to spread through <em>intact</em> Skin it doesn't <em>burrow</em> Through the skin like battery acid on the hood of a car <s type=repetition>you you</s> have to touch it to a <em>vulnerable</em> Area and hence... <s type=self-correction>we've why we've</s> been asking people and for <em>any</em> Kind of germ theory you know <em>not</em> To touch your face on the average we talk about in my course people touch their face...
